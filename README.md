React Project Accelerator was conceived to aid starting React JS projects and provide a reference implementation for bootstrapping projects. The project was itself bootstrapped from [create react app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) and uses [react material ui](https://material-ui.com/) for its UX.

The project aims to include most of the basic things one needs and includes:

-   localization and authorization via services based approach using hooks to manage state.
-   use of sass
-   forms and validation via [formik](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/) and [formik-material-ui](https://stackworx.github.io/formik-material-ui/)
-   use of HttpClient to call external REST API

## Get Started

In the project directory, you can run:

1. Install packages

`npm install`

2. Start and run the application

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode and launches browser to http://localhost:3000/react-project-accelerator

The page will reload if you make edits.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
